## Use active voice!

Academics use a lot of passive voice. It's a hard habit to break!
Active voice is usually simpler,
clearer, and more interesting to read. Here's an anonymous
example from someone at SIH:

> As part of this process we will be starting to offer options for in-person workshops

Why not just say

> We're offering in-person workshops

## Use calls to action

Think about what you want the reader to do after reading your story. Stories
about interesting projects are great, but do you
just want them to sit and think about the mysteries of the universe?
Every marketing email you get from a charity, business, political party
will include a clear **call to action**, a prompt to actually do
something with the information. If you just want people to
[read the article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35202601/),
that's great! Other good prompts can include:

- Apply online
- Contact us
- Tell us your thoughts

## Be a bit less formal

Stick to conversational, informal language in emails. That means
using real words like "Professor" instead of abbreviations
like "Assoc. Prof.", and "Doctor Y and her team" rather than
"Y et al."
