# The Annoying Bit
Every time I'm trying to communicate about a piece of code in my Outlook email, I can't formatting it using `` ` `` or

<!-- language: lang-none -->

    ```prog lang
    my code in here
    ```

It would be great using such shortcuts in Outlook (at least the Outlook web app does not have some code formatting option), like in Microsoft Teams and Slack.

# The Solution
Unfortunately the only way is to use this website [https://tohtml.com/](https://tohtml.com/) and copy paste your bit that you want to format.

Can handle many languages. The result is this nice email or Powerpoint slide.
